## Description
This project was made in order to test and improve my skills of using all technologies and languages I have learned during the Praktikum course. I present a three pages website with a server binding which is fully adaptive for all screen resolutions from 320px to 1440px. Through this website a user can find the analytics of news' subjects published during the last week. All images are optimized; the website can be used in old versions of web-browsers. The project was written in native JS language and was reviewed by experienced developers in Yandex. All files are built with Webpack technology.
